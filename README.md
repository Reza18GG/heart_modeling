This is the second project from Jadi Mirmirani's Machine Learning course.  
The goal is to analyze medical data and predict whether a patient is likely to have a heart attack.

This is a library Used:
Pandas ,Numpy 
Matplotlib ,Seaborn
Scikit Learn

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
Removed duplicate rows.  
Handled noisy data using quartiles and replaced outliers with the mean.  
Visualized data distribution using histograms and boxplots.

stats testing: 
Shapiro , T-Test , Manwhitney-U

Coorelation test:
Creat a Heatmap To Check Feature Coorelations.

Preprocessing:
Separated Feature (X) , And Label (Y)
Standarted Feature (SatndardScaler)
Split Dataset To Train And Test Sets.

Modeling:
Trained multiple models: KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM
Wrote a custom function to calculate evaluation metrics (to avoid repeating code)
